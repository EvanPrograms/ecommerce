# My E-commerce Site

An e-commerce website made using React and Node, using a postgreSQL database. There is guest and authenticated user functionality, payments and checkout using Stripe, a functional shopping cart, and ability to leave reviews. You can create new users, log in, and there is a functional forgot password system that will email you a password reset link.

You can find it on passionchocolates.com, if you'd like to deploy this site on your own, you can use AWS EC2 like I did, or use something like Fly.io or heroku. You will also need to create a database initially in postgres and set the initial products, which you can find in ecommerce/frontend/src/products.js or create your own products.
